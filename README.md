# Grok-Imagine-bypass
Bypasses the grok imagine limitations on gif and video posts by adding a hardcoded button to send the media to grok imagine.

As of the 24th of December, X added an option to expedite sending an image to grok edit. Anti-AI people figured that gif and video posts do not have this button enabled. So I brought it back.

Load this on firefox about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox and a new "Send to Grok" button should appear on your browser.

What it does: Opens a grok tab and the original tab becomes an image, you can then copypaste it to grok.

If you have a GROK API you can then use a different and more "automated" process to this but I don't have one and many don't have one and I wanted something that worked for as many as possible.

To piss on the anti crowd ofc.
